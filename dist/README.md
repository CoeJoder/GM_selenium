# Distributions
There are two distributions available: 
 - [GM_selenium.js](GM_selenium.js) (2.2 KB)
 - [GM_selenium_all.js](GM_selenium_all.js) (52 KB).

Only the "all" distribution includes the `until` module and the `By` class, as their implementations rely on the Google Closure Library, inflating the size of the distributable by about 50 KB.

All JavaScript and source-map files in this directory are generated by the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
